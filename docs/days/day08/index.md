Day 8 dives back into _C++ in 24 Hours_ for an introduction into c++ references in hours 12 and 13.  ABLATE and other libraries uses a combination of both pointers and references so a good understanding of both, their differences, and applications is important.

**Goals**
1. Complete activities for Hours 12 and 13.
2. Commit these activities and push to your private CodingAblate Repo.
